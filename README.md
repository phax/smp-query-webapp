# smp-query-webapp

Small web application that allows an arbitrary SMP query and returns JSON results
This is the API subset parts from https://peppol.helger.com for standalone usage.

This project is part of my Peppol solution stack. See https://github.com/phax/peppol for other components and libraries in that area.

A prebuild Docker image is available on Docker Hub as `phelger/smpqwa:latest` (for `linux/amd64`) and `phelger/smpqwa-arm64:latest` (for `linux/arm64`).

Supported SML servers are only `digittest` (Peppol SMK) and `digitprod` (Peppol SML).

## Configuration parameters

Default configuration is provided in file `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
Each property can be overridden via environment variables and Java system properties - see https://github.com/phax/ph-commons/wiki/ph-config for details.

The default configuration should pretty much work out of the box.
Supported properties are:

* **`global.debug`**: global debug settings. Should always be `false`
* **`global.production`**: global production mode. Should always be `true`. This has nothing to do with the Peppol stage.
* **`webapp.datapath`**: where to store data. Does not need to be a persistent volume.
* **`webapp.checkfileaccess`**: check file access on startup. Should always be `false`.
* **`rest.log.exceptions`**: this property enables or disables the detailed logging of exceptions that occur while processing REST calls. By default the logging is disabled.
* **`rest.exceptions.payload`**: this property enables or disables the provision of HTTP response contents in case of errors from the REST API. By default this is disabled. 

SMP Client configuration properties as described on https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration
